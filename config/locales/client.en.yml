            Migrate "retorts" created with the Retort plugin to "reactions" created with the <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-reactions-beyond-likes" target="_blank">Discourse Reactions</a> plugin.
            <ul>
            <li>By default, the migration will produce a report on what will be migrated, and not make any changes. Check "real run" and then run the migration again to perform the changes.</li>
            <li>By default, new Discourse Reactions data is created, but Retort data is not removed. You can remove the Retort data by checking "delete retort data" and running the migration again.</li>
            <li>Running a real migration multiple times will not produce duplicate Discourse Reactions data.</li>
            </ul>
